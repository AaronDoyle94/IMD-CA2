			<h1>Design Choices Made</h1>
			<ul class="designchoice">
			<p>I went for a simple approach to my webpage.</p>
			<li>Colours are consistent </li>
			<li>Images are used to create a flow to the webpage </li>
			<li>Mobile friendly using bootstrap container-fluid </li>
			<li>Liberal use of white space to not bore the user </li>
			</ul>
			
			<h1>Usability </h1>
			<h3>Availability </h3>
			<p>The website is available publicly from my github account. I created a repo where I could
			   host the website file and store any images and css that I use.
			   My website is also mobile friendly in how it changes layouts etc on the smaller device screen.			   
			</p>
			
			<h3>Clarity</h3>
			<p>My goal for my website was to create a website that was very clear and very transparent to the user.
			   I wanted the user to know right away what the website is about.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Learnability</h3>
			<p>Theres not really much learning to do on my website. Given that it's an informational piece about myself
			   there really isn't much to learn other than how buttons work and what the links do. And in that case, the
			   buttons and links are self-explanatory in what they do or where they bring you.
			</p>   
			
			<h3>Relevance</h3>
			<p>My website was created in such a way that it mirrors how my CV would look. I made it as clean and consise as possible
			   and the my though process for it is to get the users (or employers) attention.
